# 0x02. Minimum Operations


## Tasks

## 0. Minimum Operations
In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

    - Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    - Returns an integer
    - If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`

**Example:**

`n = 9`

`H` => `Copy All `=> `Paste` => `HH` => `Paste` => `HHH` => `Copy All `=> `Paste` => `HHHHHH` => `Paste` => `HHHHHHHHH`

Number of operations: `6`

```
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$
```

```
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x02-minoperations$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7

```

## Solution

Minimum Operations:

Noticed that Minimum Operations is just the sum of the prime factors of the number `n`

- `2 x 2 = 4` `(ans: 2 + 2 = 4)`
- `3 x 3 = 9` `( ans: 3 + 3 = 6)`
- `2 x 2 x 3 = 12` `(ans: 2+2+3=7)`
- `…`
- `…`

To calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n('H')` characters in the file:

1. Define and initalize two variables:
   - `operations = 0` # stores the numbers of operations 
   - `prime = 2`      # stores the prime factores of `n`
2. In a while loop, iterate untile `n <= 1`.
3. On each iteration, check if `prime` is a prime factor of `n` (i.e, `n % prime == 0`).
4. If `prime` is a factor of `n`:
   - Add `prime` to the number of operations `(operations += prime)` and,
   - Save the output of the floor division of `n` by `prime` `(n //= prime)` in `n`.
5. Else, increase prime by 1 `(prime += 1)` and repeat step 2 to 5.
6. Return `operations`.
