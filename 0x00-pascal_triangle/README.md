# 0x00-pascal_triangle

This directory contains the solution for the "Pascal's Triangle" project.

## Description

The "Pascal's Triangle" project is an exercise in Python programming that involves generating and manipulating Pascal's triangle. The goal is to implement a function that returns the Pascal's triangle of a given size.

## Files

- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: Contains the implementation of the `pascal_triangle` function.
- `0-main.py`: A sample main file to test the `pascal_triangle` function.

## Usage

To use the `pascal_triangle` function, import it into your Python script or interactive shell. Call the function with a positive integer `n` to get the Pascal's triangle of size `n`.

Example:

```python
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)
```
Output:

[[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

##Testing
You can run the provided test script 0-main.py to test the pascal_triangle function. Make sure you have Python installed and execute the script with the following command:

```
python3 0-main.py

```

The script will display the Pascal's triangle for a few test cases.
